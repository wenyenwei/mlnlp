### Extra Material: 
#### Scholarship Application Research Proposal - Chatbot With Natural Language Processing Deep Learning Models

Applying modern deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory and Sequence to Sequence framework on Natural Language Processing models to make a non-directive Rogerian mental therapy chatbot. The application is focused on text summarization and conversational model to offer more human-like responses.
